# Anatomy of an entry:
#
# The redirector:
#   filter: class_filter
#   payload: redirect1
#   repo: redirect1
#   tags: 10
#   repo_type: git
#
# The entry heading is free text, inasmuch as a text can be said to be free, given it exists within
# and refers to consensus reality.
#
# 'filter' can be one of 'identity_filter' ( -I on the commandline), 'class_filter' ( -C) or 
# 'fact_filter' (-F, I think) and 'payload' is the thing you're filtering on. Mucking around with
# mco find will be helpful here. 
#
# 'repo' is the name of the repository to inspect, which should be the same name as used in Gitlab, less the namespacing.
# 'tags' is the number of git tags and git branches to display in the drop-down. 
# 'repo_type' can be either 'git' or 'svn'. I've largely forgotten how the svn bits work.

An example site:
  filter: identity_filter
  payload: '/tessen|lazon|ledonia|brax/'
  repo: example_repo
  tags: 10
  repo_type: git

A different site:
  filter: fact_filter
  payload: sitetype_externalfact=live
  repo: different_repo
  tags: 10
  repo_type: git
